# Contributing

If you'd like to hack on I got issues, start by forking the repo on GitHub:

https://github.com/jonmagic/i-got-issues

The best way to get your changes merged back into core is as follows:

1. Clone down your fork
1. Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change
1. Hack away
1. If you are adding new functionality, document it in the README
1. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
1. Push the branch up to GitHub
1. Send a pull request for your branch
