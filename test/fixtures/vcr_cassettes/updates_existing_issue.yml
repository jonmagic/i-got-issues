        working with someone remotely on javascript regular expressions, I really
        wanted the ability to share what I just worked on from within scriptular.
        Rather than copy and pasting each individual box, I figured it''d be useful
        to have a link. \r\n\r\nThe code changes should be pretty straightforward.
        I did have to change CSS to make the look and feel match the other output.
        Perhaps, additionally, we could add a \"share this\" widget and send the page
        to twitter/facebook and others.","closed_by":{"login":"jonmagic","id":623,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/623?","gravatar_id":"0a5a5f09f2c85cc425f7b8db4c5e61c1","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmagic","html_url":"https://github.com/jonmagic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmagic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmagic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmagic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmagic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmagic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmagic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmagic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmagic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonmagic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}}'
