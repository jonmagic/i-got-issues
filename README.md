# Prioritized Issues

My team at GitHub prioritizes our issues into three buckets, Current, Backlog, and Icebox.

I move an issue from Backlog to Current and assign it to myself when I start working on it. Any new issues that come in during the week go into the Icebox. Once a week we have a meeting where we decide as a team what issues should become a priority and get moved from the Icebox to the Backlog. When we complete an issue we check close it.

We have been using a single tracking issue with three task lists to represent the three buckets. This requires manually editing the text of the issue each time you want to pick something off of the backlog. It requires a massive edit during our weekly planning meeting. It also requires editing every time a new issue comes to our attention that we may be responsible for.

This app aims to solve alleviate some of the pain of our current process.
